# Things missing in hooks

## `useSubscribe`
1. `useSubscribe -> subscribe` should accept `domain`. `useSubscribe` should only take `account`

## `useSubscription`
1. `useSubscribtion` should expose `getSubscription` which takes params. 
2. `useSubscribtion` should expose `isSubscribed` for convenience.
