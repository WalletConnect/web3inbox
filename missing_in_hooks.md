# Things missing in hooks

## `useSubscribe`
1. ~~`useSubscribe -> subscribe` should accept `domain`. `useSubscribe` should only take `account`~~

## `useSubscription`
1. ~~`useSubscribtion` should expose `getSubscription` which takes params.~~

## `registerWithEcho`
1. ~~Add hook to register with echo~~

# Things that would be nice

## `useSubscription`
1. `useSubscribtion` should expose `isSubscribed` for convenience.
